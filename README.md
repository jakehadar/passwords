Passwords
---------
A password manager for you to build and install on your own iPhone :)

Features
--------
* Face ID authentication.
* Does not send any data over the internet.
* FREE!

Motivation
----------
I needed a way to keep track of login credentials for infrequently used apps, but felt uncomfortable trusting a third party password manager to hold my sensitive information securely. So I decided to build my own password manager and share it! You can look thru the source code yourself and see that your passwords won't be leaked!

Note
----
* This app is not available on the App store. You must have an Apple developer license to build and install to your iPhone.
* Passwords stored in this app will not migrate to a new device. Thus, after buying a new iPhone or restoring from a backup of a different device, all your passwords will be gone. I may change this policy in a future release.
