# Passwords
A password manager for you to build and install on your own iPhone :)

## Features
* Face ID authentication.
* Does not send any data over the internet.
* FREE!

## Motivation
I needed a way to keep track of login credentials for infrequently used apps, but felt uncomfortable about the idea of using a third party password manager, where I'd have no transparency or control over what happens to my sensitive data after handing it over to some "black box." So I decided to build my own password manager and share it! You can look thru the source code yourself and see that data won't be leaked!

## Note
Passwords will not migrate to a new device. Thus, after restoring from a backup of a different device, your old passwords will not be present.
