# Passwords
A password manager for you to build and install on your own iPhone :)

## Features
* Face ID authentication.
* Does not send any data over the internet.
* FREE!

## Motivation
I needed to improve my password-reset quotient for infrequently used apps, but felt uncomfortable around the idea of keying my login credentials into a password manager where I'd have little control over what the app does with my sensitive data. 

## Note
Passwords will not migrate to a new device. Thus, after restoring from a backup of a different device, your old passwords will not be present.
