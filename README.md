Passwords
---------
A password manager for you to build and install on your own iPhone :)

Features
--------
* Face ID authentication.
* Does not send any data over the internet.
* FREE!

Motivation
----------
I needed a way to keep track of login credentials for infrequently used apps, but felt uncomfortable trusting a third party password manager to hold my sensitive information securely. So I decided to build my own password manager and share it! You can look thru the source code yourself and see that your passwords won't be leaked!

Screenshots

Note
----
* *Passwords* (this app) is not available on the App store. You must have an Apple developer license to build and install to your iPhone.
* You must have a newer iPhone with Face ID enabled to use and unlock the app.
* Credentials stored in this app are persisted against your Apple keychain. *Passwords* uses a Keychain policy that prevents credentials from migrating to new devices. Thus, after buying a new iPhone or restoring a backup from a different device, all of your password data will be gone.
